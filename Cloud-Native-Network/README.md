# Cloud-Native Network


[The 12th International Conference on Advances in System Testing and Validation Lifecycle](https://www.iaria.org/conferences2020/VALID20.html), October 18-22, 2020 - Porto, Portugal

**Abstract**

Cloud-native patterns have reshaped application development over the past decade. With the benefits of agility, resiliency, and scalability, the network domain starts embracing the cloud-native patterns to accelerate its evolution. Containerization becomes another solution of network function virtualization. Leveraging existing network services and the mature container orchestration platform, cloud-native networks attract wide attention, however the performance and scalability challenges in design and testing arise as the architecture advances. This paper presents an overview of cloud-native networks, the design and testing challenges and the development activities from open-source communities towards overcoming those issues. Performance optimization and hardware and software co-design are critical for the future success of cloud-native networks.
